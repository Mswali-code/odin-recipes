               <h2>Description</h2>

               <p class="para">This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! </p>

               <h3>Ingredients:</h2>

               <ul class="first-list">

                   <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>

                   <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>

                   <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>

                   <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>

                   <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum</li>

                   <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>

               </ul>

               <h3>Steps:</h3>

               <ol class="second-list">

                  <li>
                    <p>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</p>
                  </li>

               </ol>
