               <p class="para">Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think. This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).</p>

               <h3>Ingredients:</h2>

               <ul class="first-list">

                   <li> 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>

                   <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>

                   <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

                   <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste </li>

                   <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>

                   <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

                   <li>1 egg</li>

               </ul>

               <h3>Steps:</h3>

               <ol class="second-list">

                  <li>
                    <p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
                  </li>
